Our project, group Gary Becker, seeks to assess the population characteristics of countries with the highest rates of internal displacement due to natural disasters. 
By using our population statistics, we can retrieve the year, sex, and age range of any relevant country with data relating to our topic in the format of a dataframe. 

We have also created several visual tools, including line plots overtime which compare the top 5 nations with the highest rates of internal displacement due to natural disasters with the overall world statistic, and a barchart of these 5 nations’ population percentage that are vulnerable to natural disasters. 
The component of agriculture production is also highlighted in this project, seen through our population pyramids and statistical analysis of crop output. 

All of these components are crucial in understanding the climate crisis’ impacts on internal development around the world & how communities are impacted within them.
